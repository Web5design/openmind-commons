This is the code for running the Open Mind Common Sense knowledge-collection
site, running at http://openmind.media.mit.edu.

This code is kind of buggy and unmaintained, so if you're interested in
stepping up and fixing it, we're interested in helping you.

The code is implemented using Django and Pinax.
